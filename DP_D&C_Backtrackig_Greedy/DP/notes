Dynamic programming Idea:
------------------------
Strategy for solving optimization problems. For a given problem
p, you have an objective and constraints. For this problem p, there
may be many solutions. Feasable solutions are the solutions that satisfy
the constraints. In this set of feasable solutions, we have an optimal
solution. Dynamic programming is a strategy to help solve these problems.
Dynamic programming will try to find all possible solutions and pick the
best possible solution. THis is in constrast to Greedy which just directly
goes to the solution by taking the very next best choice in every step. But
we dont know if that solution is truly the best when we run Greedy.


Dynamic Programming and Recursion:
---------------------------------
Recursion will allow us to brute force through all possible solutions. DP
can help us convert Recursion to iteration which is a factor for optimiza-
tion. for tree problems you have to use stacks anyway so recursion there is
slightly optimal because you can use the stack system provided by the OS.
but in normal problems, recursion adds overhead with unnecessary traversals.
